                    Inspired by the principles of Healing Earth, this section invites us to reflect on the intrinsic value of nature, 
                    human dignity, care for our planet, and our ethical responsibility toward one another and the Earth.

                    Climate change is not just an environmental issue—it's a matter of justice, dignity, and our relationship with 
                    the natural world. Here, we explore these deeper connections and what they mean for how we live and act.

                    <p>
                        Nature has value in and of itself, independent of its usefulness to humans. Every tree, river, animal, 
                        and ecosystem has inherent worth and dignity. This understanding calls us to respect and protect the natural 
                        world not just for what it provides us, but because it has value in its own right.

                        <li><strong>Ecosystem Integrity:</strong> Natural systems have their own integrity and should be 
                            protected for their own sake, not just for human benefit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interconnectedness:</strong> We are part of nature, not separate from it. 
                            Our well-being is deeply connected to the health of ecosystems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Future Generations:</strong> We have a responsibility to preserve nature's intrinsic value 
                            for future generations of all species.</li>
